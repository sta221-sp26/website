# Maximum likelihood estimation

## Exercise 1

Given the simple linear regression model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i, \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})$$

Write the likelihood function and use it to show that the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$ are of the form shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/16-mle#/mle-for-beta_0-1) $(\tilde{\beta}_0)$ and [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/16-mle#/mle-for-beta_1-and-sigma2_epsilon) $(\tilde{\beta}_1, \tilde{\sigma}^2_{\epsilon})$ .

## Exercise 2

Given the linear regression model

$$
\mathbf{y}  = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \hspace{10mm} \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}\mathbf{I})
$$

Write the likelihood function and use it to show that the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$ are

$$
\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} \hspace{10mm} \tilde{\sigma}^2_{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{n}(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}})^T(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}})
$$

## Exercise 3

Given the logistic regression model

$$
\log\Big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\Big) = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}
$$

-   Write the likelihood function

-   Rework the derivation from the March 27 lecture to show the derivative solved to find the MLEs is of the form on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/19-logistic-regression#/finding-the-mle). (You can check your answer using the board work posted in Canvas).

## Exercise 4

Suppose $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ are an independent and identically distributed (iid) sample from some distribution

$$f_Y(y) = \theta(1 - \theta)^{y-1}$$

such that $y$ takes on positive integer values and $0 < \theta < 1$. Show that the MLE for $\theta^{-1}$ is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ .

## Exercise 5

Rework Exercises 1 - 2 in [HW 04](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/hw/hw-04).

# Multiple linear regression (diagnostics, multicollinearity, variable transformations, comparison)

## Exercise 6

Suppose we fit a linear model with a log transformation on the response variable, i.e.,

$$
\widehat{\log(y_i)} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_1 + \dots + \hat{\beta}_p x_p
$$

-   Show mathematically why the slope for $x_j$ and intercept are interpreted in terms of $y$ as shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/14-variable-transformations#/model-interpretation).

-   Show how $y$ is expected to change if $x_j$ increases by $t$ units.

## Exercise 7

Suppose we fit a linear model with a log transformation on one predictor variable, i.e.,

$$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1\log (x_1) + \dots + \hat{\beta}_p x_p
$$

Show mathematically why the slope and intercept are interpreted as shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/15-transformations-contd#/model-interpretation) when $x$ is multiplied by a factor $C$.

## Exercise 8

Rework Exercise 1 in [HW 03](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/hw/hw-03).

## Exercise 9

Recall that for the linear regression, the variance of the estimated coefficients are the diagonal elements of $Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) = \hat{\sigma}^2_{\epsilon}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}$. One of the [impacts of multicollinearity](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/13-multicollinearity.html?q=multicollin#/how-multicollinearity-impacts-model) is that the model coefficients will have large variances. Explain why.

## Exercise 10

Suppose you fit a simple linear regression model.

-   Draw a scatterplot that contains an observation with large leverage but low Cook's distance.

-   Draw a scatterplot that contains an observation with large leverage and high Cook's distance.

-   Draw a scatterplot that contains an observation with a large studentized residual.

## Exercise 11

-   What is an advantage of examining a plot of studentized residuals vs. fitted values rather than using the raw residuals?

-   Explain what is measured by Cook's distance. You don't need to memorize the formula but rather describe what the formula is quantifying for each observation. [Click here](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/12-conditions-diagnostics.html?q=cook#/cooks-distance-1) for the formula (slide also contains the solution).

# Logistic regression

## Exercise 12

Write the hypotheses being tested in the drop-in-deviance test output on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/22-logistic-inference#/add-interactions-with-currentsmoker). Explain how each value in the table is computed.

## Exercise 13

-   What is an advantage of using a drop-in-deviance test instead of AIC (or BIC) to compare regression models?

-   What is an advantage of using AIC (or BIC) instead of a drop-in-deviance test to compare regression models?

## Exercise 14[^1]

[^1]: From *Introduction to Statistical Learning*.

-   On average, what fraction of people with an odds of 0.37 of defaulting on their credit card payment will in fact default?

-   Suppose an individual has a 16% chance of defaulting on their credit card payment. What are the odds they will default?

## Exercise 15

Recall the model using age and education to predict odds of being high risk for heart disease.

-   Show mathematically why the interpretation for the slope for `age` in terms of the log-odds is in the form shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/19-logistic-regression#/interpretation-in-terms-of-log-odds-1).

-   Show mathematically why the interpretation for the slope of `age` in terms of the odds is in the form shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/19-logistic-regression#/interpretation-in-terms-of-odds-1).

## Exercise 16

Recall the model using age and education to predict odds of being high risk for heart disease.

-   Show mathematically why the interpretation for the slope for `education4` in terms of the log-odds is in the form shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/19-logistic-regression#/interpretation-in-terms-of-log-odds).

-   Show mathematically why the interpretation for the slope of `education4`in terms of the odds is in the form shown on [this slide](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/19-logistic-regression#/interpretation-in-terms-of-odds).

## Exercise 17

Explain why the slope of the logistic regression model is called the Adjusted Odds Ratio (or just Odds Ratio if there is one predictor).

## Exercise 18

-   Draw an example of an ROC curve such that the AUC is about 0.55

-   Draw an example of an ROC curve such that the AUC is about 0.9.

-   Explain what each point on an ROC curve represents.
